To determine if the political party of the United States president has any significant effect on the U.S. stock market, we analyzed the data of three stock market indexes and their stock prices over the length of different presidential terms. After analyzing the data, we observed that during Democratic presidential terms, there is significantly more growth in stock prices than during Republican presidential terms. However, despite our analysis, we calculated a p-value of 0.0557 with a t-test and concluded that because we could not reject the null hypothesis, the political party of the U.S. president does not have a significant effect on U.S. stock market prices.
